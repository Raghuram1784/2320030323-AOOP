# AOOP (Advance Object Oriented Programming)

# AOOP Repository

Welcome to the **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (AOOP)** repository. This repository is organized into three main sections:

- **AOOP Practical** : Weekly hands-on exercises focusing on design patterns and SOLID principles in Java.
- **AOOP Projects** : Implementation of projects using design principles, TDD, design patterns, and JUnit 5.
- **AOOP Skill** : Weekly skill-building exercises focusing on applying design patterns and SOLID principles.
