# AOOP (Advance Object Oriented Programming) 
  
# AOOP Repository :
 
Welcome to the **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (AOOP)** repository. This repository is organized into three main sections : 

- **AOOP Practical** : Weekly hands-on exercises focusing on Comparator and Comparable, Cloneable and Iterator interfaces, Threads, Sets and Maps in Java, along with design patterns and SOLID principles.
- **AOOP Projects** : Implementation of projects using design principles, TDD, design patterns, and JUnit 5.
- **AOOP Skill** : Weekly skill-building exercises focusing on applying design patterns, SOLID principles, Collections and Threads.
